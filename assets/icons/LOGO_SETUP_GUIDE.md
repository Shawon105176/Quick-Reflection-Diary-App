ðŸŽ¨ APP LOGO SETUP COMPLETE!

âœ… WHAT'S BEEN CONFIGURED:
1. Added flutter_launcher_icons package to pubspec.yaml
2. Created assets/icons/ directory
3. Configured icon generation for all platforms (Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS)

ðŸ“‹ TO COMPLETE THE LOGO CHANGE:

STEP 1: Save Your Logo
- Take the purple gradient "M" logo image you showed me
- Save it as "app_icon.png" 
- Make sure it's 1024x1024 pixels and PNG format
- Place it in: assets/icons/app_icon.png

STEP 2: Generate Icons
Run these commands in terminal:
```
flutter pub get
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
```

STEP 3: Rebuild App
```
flutter clean
flutter run
```

ðŸŽ¯ RESULT:
Your beautiful purple gradient "M" logo will become the app icon on:
- Android home screen and app drawer
- iOS home screen
- Web browser tab
- Windows taskbar
- macOS dock

The logo will automatically be generated in all required sizes and formats!

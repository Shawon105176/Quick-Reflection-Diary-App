# Temporary Instructions

Since I cannot directly save image files, please follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the purple "M" logo image you showed me
2. Save it as "app_icon.png"
3. Place it in this exact location: c:\Users\dev_shawon\Desktop\Shawon\dairy_app\assets\icons\app_icon.png

4. Then run: dart run flutter_launcher_icons

5. Finally run: flutter clean && flutter run

Your logo will then be applied to the app!
